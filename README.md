# BLOCKCHAIN
# CREATING AN ERC-20 TOKEN

FIRST WE NEED TO HAVE ANY TYPE OF CRYPTO WALLET SUCH AS METAMASK, COINBASE, ETC. FOR THIS I USED METAMASK.

# METAMASK

1.CREATE METAMASK WALLET USING THE METAMASK EXTENSION OR APP AND SAVE THE WALLET ADDRESS. 

2.CONNECT TO GORELI TEST-NETWORK IN SETTINGS.

3.MINE GORELIETH USING THIS LINK 

    (https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/). 

4.CLAIM 0.01 GOERLIETH OR MORE. NOW YOUR METAMASK ACCOUNT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS :

# 20 LAB

1.CREATING AN ERC20 TOKEN INVOLVES A SOLIDITY CONTRACT THAT IMPLEMENTS THE ERC20 TOKEN STANDARD. 

2.THIS CONTRACT WILL DEFINE THE TOKEN'S PROPERTIES, SUCH AS THE TOTAL SUPPLY, SYMBOL, NAME, DECIMALS, AND TOKEN BALANCES FOR EACH ADDRESS.

3.GO TO GIVEN LINK: 

    https://20lab.app/ 
    
(20LAB IS AN ERC-20 TOKEN GENERATOR TOOL).

4.CLICK ON OPEN APP > START. 

5.CONNECT YOUR WALLET USING CONNECT WALLET BUTTON AND SELECT METAMASK THEN ONCE YOU SEE YOUR ACCOUNT CLICK ON CONNECT.

6.CHOOSE BLOCKCHAIN GORELI(TESTNET), THEN ENTER YOUR TOKEN NAME, TOKEN SYMBOL, INITIAL SUPPLY (TAKE VERY LARGE NUMBER), 18 DECIMALS. 

7.SELECT YOUR DESIRED OPTIONS AND CLICK VALIDATE & COMPILE, IT WILL OPEN METAMASK AND ASK FOR GAS FEE FOR DEPLOYING YOUR TOKEN. 

8.VIEW YOUR TOKEN NAME AND ADDRESS IN DASHBOARD .
